Plugin that automatically creates custom role for Web Administrators and allows to edit capacities for this role.

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'web-administrator-user-role' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > Web Administrator to customise Web Administrator role capacities
